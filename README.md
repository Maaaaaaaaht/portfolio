Here is the link to my website if you want to learn a bit about me :  https://maaaaaaaaht.github.io/portfolio/ 

### Html

- I used different divs to organise my webite into section. 
- I used some href attribute to add links as well img src to add images
span tag was used to give some highlight on some words. 


### CSS 

- I choose to use flexbox to organise text and images 
- I used the media only screen for my website to fit all screens 
- I gave the header a fixed position and a top height of 0 to stay at the top of page.  
- For the header text, i used a hover selector to highlight the text and matched the color of their respective section. 

## Javascript 

- Introduced a scroll function that stops on each section when clicked on their respective name.
